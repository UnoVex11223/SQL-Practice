Calculate Total Compensation: List all employees' first_name and their total compensation. Total compensation is salary + bonus. The problem is, salary + NULL is NULL. Use COALESCE to treat a NULL bonus as 0.

Solution: 
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    (salary + COALESCE(bonus, 0)) AS total_compensation
FROM 
    sys.employees;
