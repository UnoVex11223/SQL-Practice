Employee Contact List: Create a contact list for all employees. Show employee_id and a single contact column. This contact column should be the email. If the email is NULL, use the employee_id (cast as a VARCHAR/TEXT) as the contact.

Solution:

SELECT 
employee_id,
COALESCE(email, CAST(employee_id AS CHAR)) AS contact
FROM EMPLOYEES
