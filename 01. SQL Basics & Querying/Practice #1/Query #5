Multi-Level Default: Create a 'Priority Contact' for each employee. This should be their email if it exists. If email is NULL, it should be their manager_id (cast as VARCHAR). If both are NULL, it should be the text 'Report to HR'.

Solution:

SELECT 
employee_id,
COALESCE(email, CAST(manager_id AS CHAR), 'Report to HR') AS priority_contact
FROM employees
