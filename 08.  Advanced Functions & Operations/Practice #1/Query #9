Count the number of products in each price_tier. The tiers are: 'Low' (price < 50), 'Medium' (price 50 - 150), and 'High' (price > 150)

Solution:

SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN price < 50 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN price >= 50 AND price <= 150 THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN price > 150 THEN 'High'
  END AS price_tier,
  COUNT(*) AS product_count
FROM
  products
GROUP BY
  price_tier;
