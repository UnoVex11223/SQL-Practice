Select the location from customers. First, trim spaces and convert to uppercase. Then, use a CASE statement to show 'California' for 'CA', 'New York' for 'NEW YORK', and 'Texas' for 'TX'.

Solution:

SELECT
customer_id,
TRIM(full_name) AS full_name,
CASE 
WHEN TRIM(UPPER(location)) = 'CA' THEN 'California'
WHEN TRIM(UPPER(location)) = 'NEW YORK' THEN 'New York'
WHEN TRIM(UPPER(location)) = 'TX' THEN 'Texas'
ELSE TRIM(location) END AS location
FROM customers
