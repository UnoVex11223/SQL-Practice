Select all customer full_names and add a new column location_group that says 'East Coast' for 'New York' and 'West Coast' for 'CA'.

Solution:

SELECT
  full_name,
  location,
  CASE
    WHEN TRIM(UPPER(location)) = 'NEW YORK' THEN 'East Coast'
    WHEN TRIM(UPPER(location)) = 'CA' THEN 'West Coast'
    ELSE location
	END AS location_group
FROM customers;
