Show the total quantity_sold for each product_id, but pivot the customer_ids. Show product_id and then separate columns: cust_1_qty, cust_2_qty, etc. (Use SUM and CASE).

Solution:

SELECT
  product_id,
  SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id = 1 THEN quantity_sold ELSE 0 END) AS cust_1_qty,
  SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id = 2 THEN quantity_sold ELSE 0 END) AS cust_2_qty,
  SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id = 3 THEN quantity_sold ELSE 0 END) AS cust_3_qty,
  SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id = 4 THEN quantity_sold ELSE 0 END) AS cust_4_qty,
  SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id = 5 THEN quantity_sold ELSE 0 END) AS cust_5_qty
FROM sales
GROUP BY
  product_id
ORDER BY
  product_id;
