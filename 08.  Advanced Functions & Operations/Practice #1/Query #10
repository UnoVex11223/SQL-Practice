The phone numbers in customers are messy. Select the full_name and phone, but use REPLACE to remove all dashes '-', spaces ' ', and parentheses '(' and ')'

Solution:

SELECT
TRIM(full_name) AS full_name,
REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(phone, '-',''), ' ', ''), '(', ''), ')', '') AS phone_number
FROM customers

The readable Version:

SELECT
TRIM(full_name) AS full_name,
REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[() -]', '') AS phone_number
FROM customers
