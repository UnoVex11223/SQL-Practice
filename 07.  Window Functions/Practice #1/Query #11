For each sale, calculate a 3-day moving average of sale_amount. 
This average should include the current day's sale and the sales from the two previous days.

Solution:


SELECT 

sale_date, 

AVG(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS three_day_average

FROM sales
